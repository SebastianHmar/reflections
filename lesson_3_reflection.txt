When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?


I'd use a remote repository to show off my projects to the world and also invite other people to contribute to it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Cause we might not be ready yet to accept some changes made by us or other contributers over at GitHub.
