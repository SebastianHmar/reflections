When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?


I'd use a remote repository to show off my projects to the world and also invite other people to contribute to it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Cause we might not be ready yet to accept some changes made by us or other contributers over at GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are used when you want to work on a project but you don't have the permission to modify the original project. You can fork, i.e. basically clone, it to your own GitHub Repository and then clone it to your PC
Clones are used when you want to modify the original project yourself. No need to fork if you have the permission to do changes in the original
Branches are different paths your files can follow to add different changes to your project without affecting the original file yet.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can compare the features that you have added or changes you made with the origin/master to the remote on your Github and act accordingly. Whethere to pull, fetch and merge.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without Git/GitHub, collabaration wouldn't be that tough if the persons collaborating would be sitting next to each other and always discussing the changes and features they do with their project. But still, it would be tough as there wouldn't be any medium to keep track of all their changes simultaneously.
Easier would be Git & GitHub, so they can keep track of all the changes. Especially better for those who are far from each other, as they have a central medium, GitHub, to communicate with and track changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

I'd choose a seperate branch to add changes to my project that I'm not sure if they will work and if they do, would my fellow colleagues would want my new changes to be added to the project. With a seperate branch, I could do a pull request and gain feedbacks from my partners about the changes before I merge those changes into my main branch.
For working directly in master, I'd have to be confident about the changes I'm doing, that they wouldn't create any conflicts with other people working on it too. You can do directly in master, if you're working on it alone!
