How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

If there were any differences between the two files, diff shows us that differences through - & + symbols. - meaning the changes in the old file and + means the new changes in the new file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

In Git, it's better to commit when you make logical changes even small ones and commit each one. But just make sure to group similar ones so as to not create a huge pile of unnecessary commits.

In Google Docs, I have no fucking idea

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

cause multiple files may be related to each other. Change in one file may or may not bring changes to other files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log will log all the changes giving us the date and time when those changes were made. Also gives us the author and what exact changes were made
git diff compares two commits through their ids and tell us exactly which lines were inserted or deleted

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Now that I know how to use git to look at the changes made through commits, I can now revert back to any of the old commits where my code was working fine before bugs in the recent commits. Totally cool thing to do! All hail, git!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I'll use git for when I'm working on my websites or apps as Git is the only version control system I know that can keep track of all of the changes I do in my code. Each change will be known as commit. I'll make sure not to do commits on non-logical changes
